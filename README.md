creplay

This project is about a osu! replay analyzer ***tool***, which would most likely tell you what is the damn thing you always do wrong when playing.
This should be handy when you are not able to FC anything, for some reason, but you still keep the accuracy.
I plan to implement a lot of detections of misplays or potentional misplays for future, and *give you tips and what not to do*.
Keep in mind, I'm just a guy who is really bad in osu, but wants to improve. By this sentence, *I wanted to say I don't know about all methods and possibilities of playing*.
_Feel free to contribute._
